These ImageJ macros measure intensity/area in the germplasm or the primordial germ cells (PGC) of the _Drosophila melanogaster_ embryo. 

These macros were designed with z-stack and 4 Ch merge images when I observe whole embryos and take pictures of germplasm or PGC using a confocal microscope. Especially Ch number 3 is images of what you want to measure and number 4 is Vasa staining (germplasm or PGC marker). If you use these macros, please modify the macros to suit your images.
